\subsection{Probabilistic metrics}
\label{sec:metrics}

We considered two metrics of classification probabilities, each of which is interpretable and avoids reducing probabilities to point estimates

The Brier score is defined as
\begin{eqnarray}
B &=& \sum_{m=1}^{M}\frac{w_{m}}{N_{m}}\sum_{n=1}^{N_{m}}\left((1-p_{n}(m | m))^{2}+\sum_{m'\neq m}^{M}(p_{n}(m' | m))^{2}\right)
\end{eqnarray}

The log-loss is defined as
\begin{eqnarray}
L &=& -\sum_{m=1}^{M}\frac{w_{m}}{N_{m}}\sum_{n=1}^{N_{m}}\ln[p_{n}(m | m)]
\end{eqnarray}

\aim{The CDE Loss should also be included in the paper (and sent to Kaggle, if there's still time).}

We calculate the metric within each class $m$ by taking an average of its value $-\ln[p_{n}(m | m)]$ for each true member $n$ of the class.  Then we weight the metrics for each class by an arbitrary weight $w_{m}$ and take a weighted average of the per-class metrics to produce a global scalar metric.

\subsection{Weights}
\label{sec:weights}

\aim{Rafael Martinez-Galarza will write the motivation for and definition of the weights.}

\aim{Add motivation for weighting.}

We may take weighted averages of the per-class metrics, and these weights may be considered in terms of the systematics we discussed, by upweighting or downweighting the "chosen" class most affected by the systematics.
