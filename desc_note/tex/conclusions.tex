We have presented the investigative approach to selecting an appropriate metric of the performance of classification techniques producing class posteriors in the context of \plasticc.

Even though the two metrics are structurally and conceptually different, with wholly different interpretations, they are consistent with one another and with our intuition of what makes a good classifier.

We encourage the astronomical community to think carefully about the relationship between the goals of
