\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We conclude that the Brier and log-loss metrics convey different information but are more or less consistent with our intuition for what makes a good classifier. The Brier metric includes a penalty term not present in the log-loss but somehow is always consistent with the log-loss, meaning the penalty term doesn't really make a difference. The log-loss has a larger dynamic range, which seems good but probably isn't that big a deal either.
