\aim{Add motivation with background on LSST and other surveys.}

\aim{Write background on \plasticc, Kaggle, previous classification challenges.}

Previous classification challenges (Kessler+10a, Kesser+10b) and efforts to develop supernova classifiers (Narayan+18) have focused on deterministic class assignments, but probabilistic classifications are desirable in the era of low signal-to-noise photometry

\begin{itemize}
\item    The metric must return a single scalar value.
\item    The metric must be well-defined for non-binary classes.
\item    The metric must balance diverse science use cases in the presence of heavily nonuniform class prevalence.
\item    The metric must respect the information content of probabilistic classifications.
\item    The metric must be able to evaluate deterministic classifications.
\item    The metric must be interpretable, meaning it gives a more optimal value for "good" mock classifiers and a less optimal value for mock classifiers plagued by anticipated systematic errors; in other words, it must pass basic tests of intuition.
\item    The metric must be reliable, giving consistent results for different instantiations of the same test case.
\end{itemize}

In the context of astronomy, concerns about the choice of metric for probabilistic classifications have been investigated only to a limited degree thus far (Kim\&Brunner17, Florios+18, Bethapudi\&Desai18).
\aim{Summarize conclusions of these papers.}

The Probabilistic Classification Metric (ProClaM) code used in this exploration of performance metrics is publicly available on GitHub.\footnote{\url{https://github.com/aimalz/proclam}}
