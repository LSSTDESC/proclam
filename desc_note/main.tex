\title{The Photometric LSST Astronomical Time-series Classification Challenge (PLAsTiCC): Selection of a performance metric balancing diverse science goals}

\maketitlepre

\begin{abstract}

  We describe and illustrate the process by which a global performance metric was chosen for Photometric LSST Astronomical Time-series Classification Challenge (PLAsTiCC), a Kaggle competition aiming to identify promising transient and variable classifiers for LSST by involving the broader community outside astronomy.
