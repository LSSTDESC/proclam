PRObabilistic CLAssification Metrics

## Motivation

This is a space for developing the metrics for the Photometric LSST AStronomical TIme Series Classification Challenge (PLAsTiCC), and, generically, other use cases of classification probabilities.

This repository's immediate goals were to implement the metrics described [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1b8q0mp2lDo8xbKOs15GS4WLKKNMK_TY7/view?usp=sharing) and demonstrate them on mock classification results, in an effort to identify the vulnerabilities and strengths of the metrics under consideration for [the Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/PLAsTiCC-2018).
This repository served not only as a space for experimenting with how to combine metrics for the competition's win condition but also for testing further metrics for science-specific papers.  

The code thus has a flexible, modular architecture that can be recycled for future competitions with different science goals.

## Participation
