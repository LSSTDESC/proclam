\title{The Photometric \textsc{LSST} Astronomical Time-series Classification Challenge (\textsc{PLAsTiCC}): Selection of a performance metric for classification probabilities balancing diverse science goals}

\maketitlepre

\begin{abstract}
Classifying bright astronomical objects into different classes is an essential part of transient astronomy, especially as we enter the `data deluge' era in which wide-area surveys deliver orders of magnitude more candidates than have been previously known in astronomical surveys. One way to stimulate interest in this classification problem, is to create open challenges centered around large simulated data sets. In order to evaluate different classification approaches, one needs to decide on a metric. Surveys like the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (\textsc{LSST}) will generate data that needs to be classified probabilistically, so that the products of these challenges may be used for diverse science objectives; metrics that are used on purely deterministic classification algorithms are not suitable in this case.

% indicating a need for a metric that balances a variety of goals.  incompatible with the traditional metrics used on deterministic classifications.
%  Open challenges are an effective route to promoting the development of novel techniques in astronomical data analysis.

 We describe the process used to develop an optimal global performance metric for a challenge affected by both these issues in the context of the Photometric \textsc{LSST} Astronomical Time-series Classification Challenge (\textsc{PLAsTiCC}), an open competition aiming to identify promising methods for obtaining classification probabilities of transient and variable objects by engaging the broader community outside astronomy.
  Using mock classification probability submissions that mimic some anticipated classifications of the \textsc{PLAsTiCC} data, we compare the sensitivity of two metrics of classification probabilities to various combinations of systematics, and find that multiple metrics give qualitatively consistent results, and we illustrate potential pitfalls when applying weights to classification metrics.
%ultimately making the reassuring discovery that multiple metrics yield qualitatively consistent results.
  We choose as a metric for \textsc{PLAsTiCC} a weighted modification of the log-loss due to its meaningful interpretation and superior sensitivity to the most concerning potential systematics and failure modes. Finally, we propose extensions of our procedure to ever more complex challenge goals and suggest some guiding principles for approaching the choice of a metric of probabilistic classifications.
